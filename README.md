An interactive projection game for haloween!

I've always loved haloween, and our neighborhood has a ton of little people in it, so I try to come up with a new fun trick each year for the front porch. This year I was inspired by the very fun library that <a href='https://code.google.com/p/ubidisplays/'>ubi-displays</a> generously released for the Microsoft Kinect.

<a href='http://industriumvita.com/squishable-sidewalk-spiders-kinect-multitouch-interactive-projection/'>Here is a blog post on the details.</a> Please leave me a comment there and I'll be happy to answer any questions or help you get one rolling!
